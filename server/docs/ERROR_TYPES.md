## Error Types and Descriptions

### AuthenticationError

**AuthenticationError**: An error that occurs when a user attempts to perform an action that requires authentication but hasn't provided any or has provided invalid authentication credentials.

### AuthenticationTimeoutError

**AuthenticationTimeoutError**: This error occurs when the authentication process takes too long, and the server or authentication services abort the request due to a timeout limit.

### AuthorizationError

**AuthorizationError**: This error occurs when a user is authenticated but not authorized to perform a specific action.

### BadRequestError

**BadRequestError**: This error occurs when the server cannot process a request because the request body, URL parameters, or query strings are in the wrong format or required fields are missing.

### ConfigurationError

**ConfigurationError**: This error indicates that there's a problem with the application's configuration preventing normal operation, such as incorrect settings or missing configuration files.

### ConflictError

**ConflictError**: There is a conflict with the current state of the target resource, such as duplicates.

### DataIntegrityError

**DataIntegrityError**: This error occurs when integrity constraints like unique constraints or foreign key relationships are violated by the request.

### DatabaseConnectionError

**DatabaseConnectionError**: An error that occurs when a connection to the database cannot be established. This can be caused by network issues, incorrect credentials, or problems with the database server.

### DependencyError

**DependencyError**: An error that occurs when an external dependency or microservice the application relies on doesn't respond, fails, or returns an error.

### ExternalAPIError

**ExternalAPIError**: Error that arises when calling an external API encounters issues, such as the API being unreachable or returning invalid responses.

### FileSystemError

**FileSystemError**: This error occurs when there are issues with file system operations, such as reading from or writing to the disk, indicating missing permissions or corrupted data.

### LengthRequiredError

**LengthRequiredError**: An error that occurs when the client sends a request without a `Content-Length` header when it's required.

### PermissionDeniedError

**PermissionDeniedError**: An error that occurs when an attempt to access a resource is made without the required permissions. This is opposed to `AuthorizationError`, which deals with missing permissions despite valid authentication.

### RateLimitError

**RateLimitError**: Indicates that a user's request rate has exceeded the specified rate limits.

### ServerError

**ServerError**: A general error that occurs when the server cannot process a request due to an internal problem.

### ServiceUnavailableError

**ServiceUnavailableError**: Indicates that the server is temporarily overloaded or unavailable for other reasons.

### TimeoutError

**TimeoutError**: An error that occurs when a request to the server or an external dependency exceeds the specified timeout limit.

### TooManyRequestsError

**TooManyRequestsError**: Specific to cases where a user or system has exceeded the allowable number of requests within a given timeframe, often in the context of throttling.

### URITooLongError

**URITooLongError**: An error that occurs when the requested URI is too long for the server to process.

### UnsupportedHTTPVersionError

**UnsupportedHTTPVersionError**: Indicates that the HTTP protocol version used in the request is not supported by the server.

### UnsupportedMediaTypeError
